# scRNAseq-analysis-notes
my scRNAseq analysis notes 

### The reason
Single cell RNAseq is becoming more and more popular, and as a technique, it might become as common as PCR. I just got some 10x genomics single cell RNAseq data to play with, it is a good time for me to take down notes here. I hope it is useful for other people as well.
